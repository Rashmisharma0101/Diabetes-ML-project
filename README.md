# Diabetes Prediction ML Project

This project uses a classification ML model to predict Diabetes occurence. The dataset is based on diabetes data.

- Notebook: `diabetes-week-1-ml-project`
- Model: XGBoost with threshold tuning (other techniques like SMOTE have also been experimented)
- Status: Completed

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code
2. Install dependencies (e.g. pandas, xgboost, imbalanced-learn)
3. Run all cells step by step

## Techniques Used
- XGBoost
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Threshold tuning for better recall
